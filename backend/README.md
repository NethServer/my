# Backend API

Go REST API server for the Nethesis Operation Center, providing secure authentication via Logto JWT tokens and a simplified Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system with clear separation between business hierarchy and technical capabilities.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Framework & Dependencies
- **Framework**: [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) web framework with custom middleware
- **Authentication**: Logto JWT token validation via JWKS endpoint with caching
- **JWT Handling**: [golang-jwt/jwt](https://github.com/golang-jwt/jwt) for token validation
- **Logging**: [zerolog](https://github.com/rs/zerolog) for structured, high-performance logging
- **Configuration**: Environment variables with [godotenv](https://github.com/joho/godotenv)
- **Security**: Built-in sensitive data redaction and audit logging
- **CORS & Compression**: Built-in middleware support

```

## üîê Simplified Authorization System

The API implements a clean two-layer authorization approach with clear separation:

### 1. Base Authentication
All protected routes require valid Logto JWT tokens:
```go
protected := api.Group("/", middleware.LogtoAuthMiddleware())
```

### 2. Permission-Based Access Control
Routes check for specific permissions from either user roles OR organization roles:
```go
// Checks both user and organization permissions
systemsGroup.POST("/:id/restart",
    middleware.RequirePermission("manage:systems"), methods.RestartSystem)
```

### 3. User Role-Based (Technical Capabilities)
Routes can be protected by technical capability roles:
```go
adminGroup := protected.Group("/admin", middleware.RequireUserRole("Admin"))
```

### 4. Organization Role-Based (Business Hierarchy)
Routes can be protected by business hierarchy roles:
```go
distributorGroup := protected.Group("/distributors",
    middleware.RequireAnyOrgRole("Owner", "Distributor"))
```

### Authorization Model
**Two Clear Sources of Permissions:**

#### **User Roles** (Technical Capabilities)
- **Admin**: Complete platform administration, dangerous operations
- **Support**: System management, customer troubleshooting, standard operations

#### **Organization Roles** (Business Hierarchy)
- **Owner**: Complete control over commercial hierarchy (Nethesis level)
- **Distributor**: Can manage resellers and customers
- **Reseller**: Can manage customers only
- **Customer**: Read-only access to own data

#### **Permission Logic**
```
Final User Permissions = User Role Permissions + Organization Role Permissions
```

Users get permissions from BOTH their technical capabilities AND their organization's business role.

## üìù Logging & Security

The backend features a structured logging system built on [zerolog](https://github.com/rs/zerolog) with comprehensive security features and structured output.

### Logging Features

**üîí Security-First Design:**
- **Automatic Redaction**: Sensitive data (passwords, tokens, secrets) automatically sanitized from logs
- **Pattern Matching**: Advanced regex patterns detect and redact various credential formats
- **Request Sanitization**: HTTP request/response bodies cleaned before logging
- **JWKS Protection**: JWT validation logs exclude sensitive key material

**üìä Structured Logging:**
- **Component Isolation**: Separate loggers for different system components (http, auth, rbac, logto-client)
- **Request Tracking**: Complete HTTP request lifecycle with timing and context
- **Authentication Events**: Detailed auth success/failure tracking with user context
- **Performance Metrics**: Response times, database query timing, external API calls

**üéØ Operational Intelligence:**
- **Error Categorization**: Authentication, authorization, validation, and system errors
- **User Context**: All operations linked to authenticated user and organization
- **Audit Trail**: Security-relevant events with complete context
- **Health Monitoring**: Service startup, configuration, and connectivity status

### Log Configuration

```bash
# Environment Variables
GIN_MODE=release          # Set to 'debug' for development
LOG_LEVEL=info            # debug, info, warn, error (optional)

# Development vs Production
GIN_MODE=debug            # Colorized console output, verbose logging
GIN_MODE=release          # JSON structured logs, optimized performance
```

### Sample Structured Logs

**HTTP Request Logging:**
```json
{
  "level": "info",
  "component": "http",
  "method": "POST",
  "path": "/api/auth/exchange",
  "status_code": 200,
  "latency_ms": 45,
  "client_ip": "192.168.1.100",
  "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
  "time": "2025-06-28T19:45:23Z",
  "message": "HTTP request completed"
}
```

**Authentication Events:**
```json
{
  "level": "info",
  "component": "auth",
  "method": "logto_jwt",
  "user_id": "user_abc123",
  "organization_id": "org_def456",
  "success": true,
  "time": "2025-06-28T19:45:23Z",
  "message": "Authentication successful"
}
```

**Security Events:**
```json
{
  "level": "warn",
  "component": "auth",
  "method": "logto_jwt",
  "reason": "token_expired",
  "client_ip": "192.168.1.100",
  "time": "2025-06-28T19:45:23Z",
  "message": "Authentication failed"
}
```

### Monitoring & Observability

The structured logs integrate seamlessly with monitoring systems:

```bash
# Production log aggregation
./backend 2>&1 | jq 'select(.level == "error")' | tee errors.log

# Performance monitoring
./backend 2>&1 | jq 'select(.component == "http" and .latency_ms > 1000)'

# Security monitoring
./backend 2>&1 | jq 'select(.component == "auth" and .success == false)'

# Component-specific debugging
./backend 2>&1 | jq 'select(.component == "logto-client")'
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### System Requirements

#### Runtime (Binary Execution)
- **Any 64-bit OS**: Linux, macOS, Windows
- **No dependencies** - Statically compiled Go binary

#### Development & Building
- **Go 1.23+** - [Download from golang.org](https://golang.org/download/)
- **Make** (for build automation):
  - **macOS**: Preinstalled with Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`)
  - **Linux**: Usually preinstalled, or install with package manager (`apt install build-essential`)
  - **Windows**: Install via [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/download/win), [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install), or [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) (`choco install make`)
- **golangci-lint** (optional, for linting): [Installation guide](https://golangci-lint.run/usage/install/)

#### External Dependencies
- **Logto instance** - Identity provider
- **Logto API resource** - Configured in your Logto admin console
- **Logto Management API** - Machine-to-Machine app for RBAC synchronization

### Alternative Build Methods
If Make is not available, you can use Go commands directly:
```bash
# Development
go run main.go

# Build
mkdir -p build && go build -o build/backend main.go

# Test
go test ./...
```

### Token Exchange System
This API now supports a **token exchange pattern** for enhanced security and performance:

1. **Frontend** authenticates with Logto ‚Üí gets `access_token`
2. **Frontend** calls `POST /api/auth/exchange` with `access_token`
3. **Backend** validates token, enriches with roles/permissions ‚Üí returns custom JWT
4. **Frontend** uses custom JWT for all subsequent API calls

### Setup
```bash
# Clone and navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Setup development environment (creates .env from template)
make dev-setup

# Edit .env with your Logto configuration
# Required:
# - LOGTO_ISSUER=https://your-logto-instance.logto.app
# - LOGTO_AUDIENCE=your-api-resource-identifier
```

### Development
```bash
# Install dependencies and start development server
make dev

# The server starts on http://127.0.0.1:8080 by default
```

### Building
```bash
# Build for production
make build

# Run the binary
./build/backend

# Or build for multiple platforms
make build-all
```

## üìù Configuration

### Logto Setup

#### 1. API Resource Setup
1. Create an API resource in your Logto instance
2. Configure the resource identifier as `LOGTO_AUDIENCE`
3. Ensure JWKS endpoint is accessible for token validation

#### 2. Management API Setup
1. Create a **Machine-to-Machine** application in Logto admin console
2. Configure API scopes: **Grant all Management API permissions**
3. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret to your environment variables
4. This enables the backend to fetch real user roles and permissions

#### 3. RBAC Configuration
1. Configure user roles and organization roles in Logto admin console
2. Assign permissions to roles using the simplified RBAC structure
3. Use `sync` tool to synchronize your RBAC configuration
4. Users will automatically get the correct permissions in their custom JWT tokens

```

## üë• Hierarchical Account Management

The API implements sophisticated hierarchical account management that follows business rules and organizational hierarchy:

### Authorization Rules

#### **Hierarchical Account Creation**
- **Owner (Nethesis)**: Can create accounts for any organization type
- **Distributor**: Can create accounts for Reseller and Customer organizations + own organization (if Admin)
- **Reseller**: Can create accounts for Customer organizations + own organization (if Admin)
- **Customer**: Can create accounts only for own organization (if Admin)

#### **Same-Organization Rule**
Only Admin users can create accounts for colleagues within the same organization.

### Account Management Endpoints

#### **POST /api/accounts**
Creates a new account with hierarchical validation:

```json
{
  "username": "mario.rossi",
  "email": "mario@acme.com",
  "name": "Mario Rossi",
  "phone": "+393334455667",
  "password": "SecurePassword123!",
  "userRole": "Admin",
  "organizationId": "org_acme_12345",
  "organizationRole": "Reseller",
  "avatar": "https://example.com/avatar.jpg",
  "metadata": {
    "department": "IT",
    "location": "Milan"
  }
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "code": 201,
  "message": "account created successfully",
  "data": {
    "id": "user_generated_id",
    "username": "mario.rossi",
    "email": "mario@acme.com",
    "name": "Mario Rossi",
    "phone": "+393334455667",
    "userRole": "Admin",
    "organizationId": "org_acme_12345",
    "organizationName": "ACME S.r.l.",
    "organizationRole": "Reseller",
    "isSuspended": false,
    "createdAt": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "updatedAt": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "metadata": {
      "department": "IT",
      "location": "Milan"
    }
  }
}
```

#### **GET /api/accounts**
Retrieves accounts with hierarchical filtering:

- **Owner**: Sees all accounts across all organizations
- **Distributor**: Sees accounts from organizations they created + sub-organizations
- **Reseller**: Sees accounts from Customer organizations they created
- **Customer**: Cannot access this endpoint

**Query Parameters:**
- `organizationId`: Filter accounts by specific organization

#### **PUT /api/accounts/:id**
Updates account information with role and organization changes.

#### **DELETE /api/accounts/:id**
Deletes an account from the system.

### Hierarchical Data Visibility

The system implements data visibility based on organizational hierarchy and creation relationships:

#### **Visibility Rules**
- **Owner**: Can see all organizations and their accounts
- **Distributors**: Can see:
  - Resellers they created (`customData.createdBy = distributor.organizationId`)
  - Customers created by their resellers (transitively)
- **Resellers**: Can see:
  - Customers they created (`customData.createdBy = reseller.organizationId`)
- **Customers**: Cannot access organization management endpoints

#### **Creation Tracking**
When accounts are created, they include visibility metadata:
```json
{
  "customData": {
    "createdBy": "creating-organization-id",
    "createdAt": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "userRole": "Admin",
    "organizationId": "target-org-id",
    "organizationRole": "Reseller"
  }
}
```

## üß™ Testing

```bash
# Primary commands (recommended)
make test                          # Run all tests
make test-coverage                 # Run tests with coverage report
make fmt                           # Format code (required for CI)

# Direct Go commands for specific needs
go test ./jwt                      # Test JWT package only
go test ./middleware               # Test middleware package only
go test -v ./...                   # Verbose test output
go test -race ./...                # Race condition detection
go test -count=1 ./...             # Force test execution (disable cache)
```

Coverage reports are generated in `coverage.out` and uploaded as GitHub Actions artifacts for CI tracking.

### Pre-commit Workflow

Before committing changes, always run these commands to ensure CI passes:

```bash
make fmt                           # Format code (required for CI)
make test                          # Run all tests
make lint                          # Run linter (if golangci-lint installed)

# Then commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "your commit message"
```

**Note**: The CI pipeline will fail if code is not properly formatted with `gofmt -s`.

## üîß Development Commands

```bash
# Format code
make fmt

# Run linter (requires golangci-lint)
make lint

# Clean dependencies
make tidy

# Clean build artifacts
make clean

# Install binary globally
make install

# Show all available commands
make help
```

## üìä Monitoring & Debugging

### Logging
The application uses structured logging via the `logs` package:
- Request/response logging in debug mode
- Authentication and authorization events
- Error tracking and debugging information

**Key Log Messages:**
```
[INFO][LOGTO] Management API token obtained, expires at ...
[INFO][LOGTO] Enriched user user-123 with 1 user roles, 4 user permissions, org role 'Distributor', 4 org permissions
[INFO][ACCOUNTS] Account created in Logto: Mario Rossi (ID: user_123) by user user_456
```

### Health Check
- `GET /api/health` returns server status and can be used for health monitoring

### CORS
CORS is configured for development with permissive settings. For production, configure appropriate origins.

### Troubleshooting

#### **Token Exchange Issues**
1. **Management API Connection Fails**
   - Check `LOGTO_MANAGEMENT_CLIENT_ID` and `LOGTO_MANAGEMENT_CLIENT_SECRET`
   - Verify Machine-to-Machine app has all Management API permissions
   - Check network connectivity to Logto instance

2. **Empty Permissions in JWT**
   - Verify user has roles assigned in Logto admin console
   - Check role permissions configuration in Logto
   - Ensure user has organization membership

3. **403 Forbidden on API Calls**
   - Verify JWT contains expected permissions (decode at jwt.io)
   - Check middleware permission requirements in source code
   - Confirm RBAC configuration matches API expectations

#### **Account Management Issues**
1. **Account Creation Denied**
   - Check hierarchical authorization rules
   - Verify user has Admin role for same-organization creation
   - Confirm target organization exists and is valid

2. **Visibility Issues**
   - Check organization creation relationships in Logto
   - Verify `customData.createdBy` tracking
   - Confirm user's organization role permissions

#### **Debugging Tools**
```bash
# Test token exchange
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/exchange \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"access_token": "YOUR_LOGTO_TOKEN"}'

# Check user profile with custom JWT
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/auth/me \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CUSTOM_JWT"

# Test specific permissions
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/systems \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CUSTOM_JWT"
```
